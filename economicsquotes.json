Society still traditionally assigns to woman the role of money-handler rather than money-maker, and our assigned specialty is far more likely to be home economics than financial economics.", "author": "Paula Nelson"}, {"quote": "[Ruling elie] haven't given up on neoliberal ideology, they use it. And I think they've normalized that ideology, the notion that, for instance, that economics should govern all of social life, to such a degree that it becomes increasingly difficult to challenge it.", "author": "Henry Giroux"}, {"quote": "Much of economics isn\\'t difficult, or rather, the difficulty is in cooking up arguments to \"prove\" that commonsense conclusions are wrong. The fact is that many commonsense conclusions are quite correct, and it takes a lot of education to get you to believe different.", "author": "Jerry Pournelle"}, {"quote": "Star Wars film is breaking all previous box office records.
