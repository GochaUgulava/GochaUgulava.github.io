You then sell your milk at the former elevated price to some government-owned distributor which then dumps your milk onto the market at east-European prices to make Europe competitive. You spend the money you got as a subsidy on two new cows and then go on a demonstration to Brussels complaining that the European farm-policy is going drive you out of your job.\nEASTERN EUROPEAN DEMOCRACY: You have two cows. You sell the milk (diluted with some water) at a high price to the neighbors or to anyone at the open-air market. If somebody asks for receipt, you charge for a two times higher price, so nobody will request an invoice. For concerned families with small babies you claim that the milk is \"bio\", though you collect the grass for feeding at the side of the highway and you keep the milk in plastic barrels used previously as containers of dangerous chemicals. Later, your neighbor or anybody from town will steal the cows and will buy their meat for a high price, and if you ask for a receipt, you will be charged for a two times higher price.\nFINNISH SOCIALISM: You have two cows. Soon you have to kill one of them because in the Netherlands there is an overproduction of milk and the European Union rules say so. When you do so, you realize that it was not necessary, only the system was too slow in getting you the up-to-date news. From the stress, you get an ulcer in your stomach so you go to a doctor. The doctor realizes that this ulcer is a serious one, so you need an urgent treatment. Therefore, you soon get a call to the local hospital. The call's date is for 3 months later, because there is a queue with more urgent cases. Then your ulcer becomes even more serious because you remember that 40 percent of your income is taken for social tax. \n"}, {"text": "Q: What do you call a little girl in a brown dress who is running across a playground?\nA: A brownian motion.\n"}, {"text": "David Gunn (Scotland): \"Eighty percent of rules of thumb only apply 20 percent of the time\" \n"}, {"text": "This one I attribute to Richard Thaler, now at the Univ of Chicago.\nWhen an economist says the evidence is \"mixed,\" he or she means that theory says one thing and data says the opposite. \n"}, {"text": "From Peter Kennedy's \"A Guide to Econometrics\" (MIT Press, 1992):\n(P. 7) [Econometrics is...] the art of drawing a crooked line from an unproved assumption to a foregone conclusion.\" \n"}, {"text": "True story: One day in microeconomics, the professor was writing up the typical \"underlying assumptions\" in preparation to explain a new model.
